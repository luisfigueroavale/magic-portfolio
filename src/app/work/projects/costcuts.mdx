# CostCuts - Democratizing Enterprise Software Discounts

CostCuts is a revolutionary platform that helps smaller startups and SMBs save 10-30% on their software spend through collective buying power, all without charging any fees.

## The Problem

Software costs are eating into startup runways faster than companies can hire. Many enterprise software providers offer significant discounts for large companies, but smaller startups and SMBs are left paying full price.

## Our Solution

CostCuts aggregates the buying power of multiple startups to negotiate enterprise-level discounts with software providers. We don't charge startups a dime - our revenue comes from the software providers themselves.

## Key Features

- **No Fees**: We don't charge startups anything
- **Collective Buying Power**: Access to enterprise-level discounts
- **Proven Savings**: 25% off Rippling, 10% off Vanta, 30% off LinkedIn Sales Navigator
- **YC Backed**: Built with my co-founders Lakshya Rajoria and Howard Zhu

## Product Hunt Success

CostCuts achieved #4 Product of the Day on Product Hunt with zero promotion, demonstrating strong product-market fit and user demand.

## How It Works

1. Startups join our collective buying group
2. We negotiate with software providers for bulk discounts
3. Startups get enterprise-level pricing without enterprise-level commitments
4. Everyone wins - startups save money, providers get more customers

## Impact

Since launching, CostCuts has helped dozens of startups save thousands of dollars on their software spend, allowing them to allocate more resources to product development, hiring, and innovation.
